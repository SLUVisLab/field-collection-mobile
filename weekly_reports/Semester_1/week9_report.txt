Alex: I altered our prototype to match the new format discussed with Dr. Stylianou. This required making one new page and making use of route parameters to pass values between the pages.

Hamad: I'm working basically trying to find a way to access google sheets through react native. Google provides an api for google sheets access, but i'm currently having problems using libraries in order to access google sheets correctly.

Julia: I worked to establish a new mode of data storage for the picker which can hopefully be connected to the api in the future.
