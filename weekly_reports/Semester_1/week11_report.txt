Julia: this week we visited the field site and learned that most of what we thought we were doing is not what the client actually needs. So, this week has been about navigating some of those issues and working out new schemas and details. For example, switching to a firebase database instead of just using Sheets to keep track pof information. Tot ackle this specific problem I've been learning a lot about firebase and going through docs on how to utilize it with React. Moving forward with this week I will continue learning about the implementation of our new database.

Hamad: I am scratching the google sheets api project for now. I am working on getting the picker to work correctly, as in set it up so that it will be able to take in a json and be able to display it as well. We also visited the field site and learned that most of what we thought we were doing is not what the client actually needs lol. So, we basically revamped our deliverable 2 goals (again!) and are going to be pursuing that for the next few weeks. 

Alex: Part of our visit to the field site this week made us realize that our method of plant identification (before phenotyping) would not work. We need to create a grid (similar to that of the cs seating chart) so researchers can click on a plant they want to phenotype. I made the grid for the app. I'm trying to make it so that the formatting is correct, and so that we can also correctly link up the different options on the grid.
