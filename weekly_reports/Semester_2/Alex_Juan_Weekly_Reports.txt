Week 1: I added a context to the app, so we can store variables and methods in a global scope (we were passing them between screens before). I also modified plot view to include row and column labels.

Week 2: I redid PlotView to prepare for linking up ith database connection. Added functionality for different plant species as well as dead plants.
