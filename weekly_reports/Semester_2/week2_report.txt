Hamad Khan: I worked on understanding firestore, and also going through the logistics of our app again. We currently have a lot of question marks surrounding our app, and we need to solve these questions before moving forward basically. Our immediate goal is to figure out how we're going to get the data from the fields to the database in an efficient manner. Specifically, we currently have an excel spreadsheet of dimensions of the field in real life, and we need to find a way to store that in a db.
