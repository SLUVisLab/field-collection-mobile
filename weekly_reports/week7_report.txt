Hamad Khan:
I hooked up the home screen to the QR code scanning screen. The QR code scanning functionality works as well, and it opens up a webview of what was scanned. I also refactored the code into their own seperate screens. We all worked on completing the slides for the presentation, and thought about how we are going to implement an API for selecting and updating forms in the app.

Julia Pratt:
I tried really hard to make the form select screen and the form complete screen. I had a lot of difficulties with the forms drop down select menu. I need to talk to my group about proper navigation techniques- notably, getting from the form submission screen to the form complete screen. I'm also going to need to think about how to connect the forms API with the form selection screen. Aside from coding I contributed to the slides presentation for our first deliverable talk.
